# YMFF
## Feature management made easy

Every company I worked at needed a way to manage feature availability in shipped apps, without changing code. Surprisingly enough, [feature flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle) (a.k.a. feature toggles a.k.a. feature switches) tend to cause a lot of struggle.

YMFF is a nice little library that makes management of features with feature flags—and management of the feature flags themselves—a bliss. YMFF provides a complete implementation of the mechanism: you get everything you need to start in just a few minutes. But since YMFF is protocol-based, you can replace nearly any component of the system with your own, customized implementation.
